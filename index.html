        <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous

        of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
        pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
        fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
        shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
        distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
        nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
        welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims
        of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
        to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
        these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
        greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
